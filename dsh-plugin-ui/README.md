# dsh-plugin-sportsdesk-desk-status

A **separate**, removable DSH bundle for the SportsDesk desk. It adds one compact,
single-line, ambient row to the Harness Web UI below the composer
(`conversation.composer.dock`) and reports the local SportsDesk webview service
from **real data** — it never renders a mocked or assumed state.

This directory is independent of `../dsh-plugin/` (the read-only Host tools
bundle): different package, different row id, installable and removable on its
own.

## What the row shows

| Observation                                                                       | Row text                  | Dot     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| First probe not finished                                                          | "checking…"               | idle    |
| `/health` fetch rejects / non-2xx                                                 | "service down"            | error   |
| `/health` ok, but `/api/status` is 404 **or** the `/health` body has no `ingress` | "stale build (uptime 5d)" | warn    |
| `/health` ok and `/api/status` answers                                            | "current"                 | success |
| `/health` ok but the `/api/status` probe itself failed                            | "status probe failed"     | warn    |

Data source: `http://127.0.0.1:4020/health` and
`http://127.0.0.1:4020/api/status`, polled every 30 s (inside the ≤60 s bound),
each request bounded by `AbortSignal.timeout(3000)`. The tooltip carries the
probe URL, the last check time, the HTTP status and the error, if any.

The `/api/status` probe and the `ingress` field check exist because the running
service can answer `/health` while predating the checkout. Measured on
2026-11-02: `uptimeSeconds` 457596 (~5.3 days), `/api/status` 404, `/health`
without `ingress` — a naive health check says "healthy"; this row says
**stale build**.

## CORS

Measured before wiring the fetch: `curl -si http://127.0.0.1:4020/health`
returns `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (same for `/api/status`), so the page
may read both. A browser cannot distinguish a network failure from a CORS
rejection, so a rejected fetch is reported as "service down" rather than being
explained away as healthy.

## Rules followed

- `package.json` declares `dsh.client` (`platform: web`, `immediately: true`,
  `inject` ordering) and exports `./client` beside the bundle patch.
- The Client factory is side-effect free; the locale dictionary and the fetch
  loop are registered in `apply` with `ctx.effect` and cleaned up on dispose.
- Visible copy is registered through the Client locale service
  (`ctx.locale.register` + the slot's `locale:` option, which supplies `t`), in
  both built-in locales.
- Chrome uses only host `--dsw-alias-*` tokens (`label-primary`,
  `label-secondary`, `label-tertiary`, `state-*`); React comes from the browser
  module table; no Harness Client package is imported; the app root is not
  touched.

## Install / remove

```
plugin_manager({ action: "install_bundle",
                 target: "/Users/nolarose/code/sportsdesk-ops/dsh-plugin-ui" })
plugin_manager({ action: "remove_bundle", target: "dsh-plugin-sportsdesk-desk-status" })
```

## Verification status

The bundle installs and the client slot registration is inspectable through
`cordis_inspect_query` (`client`, `Slots`, `listSubTree` with
`root: "conversation.composer.dock"`). Rendered pixels are **unverified**: this
session has no browser control, and the Client inspect provider timed out while
authoring. A DSH restart may be required before the row appears if the client
module generation was cached.
