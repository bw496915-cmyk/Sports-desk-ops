/**
 * Client half of the SportsDesk security/fraud bundle: the read-only operator console.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *
 * A left-sidebar entry (`sidebar.panellist`, id "sportsdesk-security") plus the
 * main-column page that entry selects (`main`, keyed by the same id — the
 * sidebar owns the button, its tooltip and the selected state; this module owns
 * the shield glyph and the page). The page is the human view of the desk's
 * security posture:
 *
 *   Overview   the per-source matrix (state, provenance, records, age, reason),
 *              the corpus summary, the weak-label model summary with its limits,
 *              the F402 weblog posture/flags and a bet-aggregate strip.
 *   Queue      the operator triage queue: model/findings-ranked accounts with
 *              per-row score+band, critical/high counts, desk-flag counts, bets
 *              and reasons; clicking a row loads that account's dossier without
 *              leaving the tab.
 *   Explore    descriptive exploration under frozen constants: corpus/constants,
 *              the detector backlog with field-availability chips, and three
 *              "exploratory — not a finding" candidates (market entropy,
 *              unattributed override, stake concentration) with their
 *              question/method/caveat and compact tables.
 *   IP graph   masked IP-network clusters plus the distinct/shared-IP summary.
 *   Findings   named detectors with severity/category filters, expandable
 *              evidence, observed/threshold values and insufficient-data chips.
 *   Model      the transparent weak-label logistic report: features, metrics
 *              (AUC-ROC, average precision, precision@1%/5%, Brier), temporal
 *              validation, drift, calibration bins and limits. A missing model
 *              artifact renders "not fitted" plus the exact fit command —
 *              never zeroed metrics.
 *   Dossier    an account/agent id lookup: model score and band, top
 *              contributions, bet aggregates, findings, masked IP clusters and
 *              evidence pointers.
 *
 * DATA (same-origin GET routes served by this bundle's Host half)
 *
 *   /api/security/status      /api/security/bets       /api/security/ip-graph
 *   /api/security/weblog      /api/security/patterns   /api/security/model
 *   /api/security/queue?limit=25  /api/security/explore?limit=10
 *   /api/security/dossier?id=     /api/security/research
 *
 * A 200 body is `{ ok: true, ...CLI payload }`; a CLI failure is a 502
 * `{ ok: false, reason, message }`; a 404 means the installed Host bundle does
 * not register the route. Every payload carries `sources[]` (FraudSourceState)
 * so the page can state provenance and freshness instead of trusting the
 * numbers.
 *
 * HONESTY RULES
 *
 * - Nothing has been measured before the first response: the page says loading,
 *   never "everything is fine" and never a fake zero.
 * - A missing source renders "missing" plus its reason, and a null record count
 *   renders "not counted" — missing is not 0.
 * - Fixture provenance is labelled with a fixture chip; it is context, never an
 *   observation.
 * - A failed refresh keeps the last payload visible, labelled stale with the
 *   time it was received, plus the failure reason and Retry.
 * - Model output has no "probability of fraud" copy: it ranks a desk-flag
 *   proxy, and the page says "proxy label — not fraud probability" wherever the
 *   model is summarized.
 * - The page is read-only: no mutation button exists, and `fit` is not offered
 *   (the exact command is shown for the operator to run).
 *
 * RULES FOLLOWED
 *
 * - The factory is side-effect free: it builds constants, the store and the
 *   components. Locale registration and both slot registrations are owned
 *   effects created in `apply`.
 * - One module-level store; the panel fetches on activation (status + weblog +
 *   bets), lazily loads a tab's route on that tab's first activation, loads the
 *   dossier on submit, and Refresh re-measures the active tab. One
 *   AbortController per fetch; a superseded or unmounted request is aborted and
 *   can never publish. There is no poll timer; the timeout timer is cleared.
 *   Nothing publishes after disposal.
 * - Visible copy goes through the Client locale service (`ctx.locale.register`
 *   plus the `locale:` registration option, which supplies `t`), in both
 *   built-in locales, with a dictionary fallback so a missing seat renders
 *   English instead of a key.
 * - Chrome uses only host `--dsw-alias-*` color tokens; the sidebar glyph uses
 *   `currentColor`, so the host owns its color in every theme. No literal
 *   colors, no page-root writes, no direct DOM construction.
 * - React comes from the browser module table. No Harness Client package is
 *   imported and no DOM outside this page's own slot is read or written.
