# External-view guard canary

The `external-view` branch of `manager.js` `setAccountInfo` loads a module named by a URL parameter
with no auth check. The client overlay wraps that method with a guard behind a default-false flag;
this runbook is the only sanctioned way to turn it on.

## What is gated

- `flags.externalViewGuard` is latched at preload from `?external-view-guard=1` or an injected
  `window.__F402_EXTERNAL_VIEW_GUARD__ = true`; default `false`.
- `?no-seam` wins over `external-view-guard` by dependency: the guard calls `isAuthenticated()` and
  `isAllowedModule()`, so with the seam disabled the flag latches `false` and the guard cannot run.
- With the flag on, the branch requires `isAuthenticated()`; a disallowed or traversal `module` id is
  rejected before `require`; a guard evaluation error fails closed. Unauthenticated ends the session.
- With the flag off (normal), the wrapper delegates immediately — merging the code changes no
  behavior.

## Preconditions

1. **A logged-in Chrome profile.** `--login` requires the keychain (`secrets:f402`) or a TTY prompt;
   an unattended environment needs a profile that already has a live session. Provision one with
   `bun run session:login --from-profile <dir>` (from a real Chrome profile), or bootstrap it once
   with `bun run capture:f402-har -- --login --profile <dir>` on a machine that can authenticate.
   There are no credentials in CI; without a profile the probe exits 2 or 4, and the canary does not
   open.
2. **Active wagering.** The acceptance selector is `[data-wager-number]`, which matches zero nodes
   on an empty ticker. Run the canary while wagers are flowing; **an empty ticker is not a pass
   state**, and `exit 1` for a missing render target there is expected rather than a seam failure.
3. **Chrome backend.** Phase 1 is Chrome/CDP only. WebKit sessions are `covered: false` (exit 3) and
   are out of scope until the injection path exists.

## Run

```sh
bun run probe:client-seams \
  --profile <logged-in-profile> --guard \
  --expect-rendered '[data-wager-number]'
```

`--profile` is a profile that already has a live session. **Do not pass `--login` with it:** `--login`
is only for provisioning/renewing a session via the keychain/TTY path, and in an unattended
environment it fails with `MissingF402CredentialsError` even when the profile itself is logged in.
Use `--login` only on a machine that can authenticate interactively, then provision the profile with
`bun run session:login --from-profile <dir>`.

`--guard` appends `external-view-guard=1` to the probed URL, so the preload latches the canary flag
for that document. Without it the probe still runs but exercises the dead-by-default path.

## Acceptance

| Exit | Meaning                                                       | Action                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | structural pass, authenticated, `[data-wager-number]` matched | **canary passes** — keep the flag on for this instance, still confirm rows visually on the first session |
| 1    | structural failure, or render target absent                   | do not enable; on an empty ticker re-run during active wagering before treating it as a failure          |
| 2    | structural pass, authenticated unverified                     | session not exercised; do not enable                                                                     |
| 3    | not covered (WebKit)                                          | out of scope, phase 2                                                                                    |
| 4    | could not run (auth/profile)                                  | fix the profile, do not enable                                                                           |

The selector is the automated acceptance; a visual check that ticker rows populate is still
recommended for the first canary session because the selector proves the render target exists, not
that the data path is healthy.

Rejections are queryable in the probe payload: `probe.diag.seam.rejectCount` and
`unflushedRejects` (0/0 on a clean canary session). A non-zero count means the guard blocked a
`module` id; `unflushedRejects > 0` means `system/log` had not resolved yet and the buffer is still
pending flush.

## Scope and navigation

- **In scope:** the internal bet-ticker component opened inside `manager.html` (same document), so
  the preload latch persists across the `require("manager/module/bet-ticker")` call.
- **Out of scope:** a `window.open` popup or any new document that does not carry
  `?external-view-guard=1`; the preload runs again there and latches `false`. Manual reload without
  the parameter likewise loses the flag. Re-pass the parameter per navigation. If popup coverage is
  needed, persist the latch in `sessionStorage` on first read as a follow-up, with its own review.

## If a vendor update moves the branch

`pin:cdn` reports `guard_anchor_missing`, `pin:cdn:update` refuses to pin, and the preload logs
`external-view guard cannot install: setAccountInfo missing`. Do not open the canary: update the
overlay against the new `manager.js`, re-run its tests, then re-pin. A green probe with the flag on
is not sufficient if `managerGuardInstalled` is false — the structural gate already fails there.

## Rollback

Open the page without `?external-view-guard=1` (next navigation loses the latch) or with
`?no-seam` to disable the seam entirely. No redeploy and no code revert is required. If the guard
itself misfires, also report the probe's exit code and the `structural`/`authenticated` fields.
