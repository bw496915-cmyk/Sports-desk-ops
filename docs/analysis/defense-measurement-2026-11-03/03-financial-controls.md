# 3. Financial-controls audit

Scope: `updateDistribution`, `deleteWager`, `getMasterSheet`, `getSettledFigure` (plus the adjacent
`adjustBalance`, `vigSetupInsert`, `updateByColumn`). `[OBSERVED]` = recorded in this repo's
evidence; `[CODE]` = read from the pinned controller/modules or repo code; `[UNVERIFIED]` = needs
the server team / business owner / live test.

## Call sites, bounds and audit

Money tiers: **confirmed money-moving with no client-visible bound** = the code posts a monetary
value and the only client check is an `<input type="number">` `[CODE]`; **confirmed destructive,
payload uncaptured** = a delete/void path exists but its request body was never captured;
**read-only money view** = reads accounting/figures without moving money; **suspected money-moving**
= name/UI evidence only, no code path read; **suspected money-adjacent** = settings that may affect
money but are not money transfers. A grep hit is not a finding until it carries a tier.

**`updateDistribution` is missing from the ledger entirely, and `getMasterSheet` has no row of its
own** (only a passing mention in another operation's capture note). That is itself a finding: the
ledger is the repo's evidence contract, and the primary money-mutation operation bypasses it.

## The reconciliation attempt (and why it cannot close)

Attempted reconciliation from evidence available in this repo:

1. **Ledger → captures:** no captures exist for `updateDistribution`, `deleteWager`,
   `getMasterSheet`, `getSettledFigure`, `adjustBalance` (`capturedResponse: false`); the ledger has
   no `updateDistribution`/`getMasterSheet` rows. **No wire payloads to reconcile** `[OBSERVED]`.
2. **Settlement store → figures:** the store records wager-level observations only; there is no
   distribution, adjustment or settled-figure table, so F2 cannot be checked even in principle from
   this repo `[CODE]`.
3. **Client audit → mutations:** the `Log/write` line is emitted by the client after success and
   carries a human-readable `description`; it is not linked transactionally to a mutation id, and a
   tampered request can skip it. **Not a ledger** `[CODE]`.

**Finding (this is the deliverable, per the task's own rule that it outranks every XSS in flight):**

> The **client repo** contains no reconciliation invariant for `updateDistribution`, `deleteWager`,
> `getSettledFigure` or `adjustBalance`, and no captured wire evidence for the financial mutations.
> Whether the **system/server** reconciles is **unknown** — that is the business owner's and server
> team's question sitting beside item 2. Until they answer, the measured finding is narrower and
> stronger: **the client cannot tell whether the server is reconciling, and the client's own audit
> path is a claim, not a ledger entry.** `Log/write` fires _after_ AJAX success, from the client: a
> malicious client omits it, a crashed tab loses it, and a retry double-writes it. It is
> non-atomic, forgeable and omittable by construction — a property of the pattern, not of this
> repository's coverage.

This does not claim the vendor has no ledger; it claims the repo cannot see one, and the only audit
the client can produce is not evidence of a mutation. Item 3's acceptance is therefore: **the server
team confirms a server-side ledger/invariant exists (with its definition), or produces a written
finding that none does.** That cannot be satisfied by client code.

## Pending-customer count — Path B blocked (2026-11-04)

The question "how many customers have pending bets" is addressed in
[08-pending-customer-count-feasibility.md](./08-pending-customer-count-feasibility.md). Finding: no
decision consumer is documented; the portal's `Pending 2,400` is **$2,400 in wager amount**, not a
customer count; and the three observed namespaces (`getPending` `TicketNumber-WagerNumber`,
`getHistory` `LOGIN|WAGERNUMBER`, `getTransactionList` `DocumentNumber`/`GradeNum`) share no join key.
The count is blocked on the authoritative transaction log/reconciliation plus settlement and
compliance definitions — input to this item, not a replacement for it. Artifact-level verification
is in [08-pending-source-finding.md](./08-pending-source-finding.md): the BB55103 33-row ledger
reconciles 33/33, final balance = `CurrentBalance`, and `AvailableBalance = Current − Pending +
CreditLimit`; pending is not a TranType; no aggregate pending-count endpoint exists in the available
code/probes.

## What the business owner must answer

1. What is the authoritative ledger for distribution changes, balance adjustments, wager
   deletions and settled figures — table, report, or external system?
2. What invariants does it enforce (F1–F6 above), and who checks them, on what cadence?
3. Is every mutation attributable to a server-derived principal, or to fields the caller supplied?
4. What is the detection/response path when an invariant breaks?

Until those are answered, item 6 cannot rank the client XSS controls above the financial gap.
