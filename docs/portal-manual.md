# Portal user manual — digested reference

Our own structured digest of the vendor manual, kept in the repo so the surfaces it documents can
be checked against the code. The manual itself is third-party documentation and is **not** copied
here; only short UI labels (`Game Admin`, `Position`, `Vig Setup`) and paraphrased behaviour appear.

| Raw text        | `scratch/portal-manual/manual-<sha8>.txt` — gitignored, regenerate with `bun run manual:fetch` |

If `bun run manual:fetch` reports a different SHA-256, the vendor updated the manual: re-read this
digest against the new text before trusting the "status" column below.

## What the manual does and does not cover

It is an operator FAQ. It documents **workflows and permission gates**, not field dictionaries —
nothing about `Level`, `SeqNumber`, `WagerType` codes or report columns. The wire shapes in this
repo come from captures (`docs/evidence/captures/`), not from the manual.

## Rules this digest puts into force

1. **No delete control without a pre-game verdict.** `preGame` is computed from `gameDateTime`
   against the request clock, and is a fact about the fixture — not a claim that the operator has
   the portal permission described in Q3.
2. **No "line edge" score.** Q6's threshold needs the market price at bet time. `AdjSpread` /
   `OrigSpread` measure the accepted line against the original line, which is a different quantity.
3. **Position labels come from the wager type**, matching Q4's vocabulary: `S` → Straight,
   `P` → Parlay, `T` → Teaser; unknown codes stay `Other` rather than being guessed.
4. **Profile mutations stay out.** Q5, Q9, Q10, Q11 and Q12 are all writes into the portal. This
   repo is read-only against production unless a task is explicitly a deploy.

## Reproducing

```sh
bun run manual:fetch            # download + extract into scratch/portal-manual/
bun run manual:fetch --raw      # ...and print the text
```

The extractor (`scripts/fetch_user_manual.ts`) handles object streams, Identity-H subset fonts with
`/ToUnicode` CMaps, and simple WinAnsi fonts. A PDF without a text layer (scanned) would extract
nothing; this one is text-native.
