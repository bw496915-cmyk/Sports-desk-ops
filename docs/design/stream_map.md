# Stream map — seven GSLive/F402 topics

One table so a new design note cannot re-conflate WebSocket frames with R2 snapshots. WS is
ephemeral delta/event transport; R2 is the replayable snapshot. A WS channel never implies an R2
object and an R2 object never updates per event.

## Boundary rules the table encodes

- **GSLive vs Fantasy402:** streams 1/4 are GSLive Partner 118 (`plive.sportswidgets.pro`); streams
  2/3/5 are Fantasy402 (`fantasy402.com`). A producer may read both, but an event/object belongs to
  exactly one source family.
- **WS = delta/event, R2 = snapshot.** Only streams 1, 2, 3 have WS channels. Streams 4, 5, 6, 7 are
  batch/object-only. A subscriber that needs history fetches the R2 snapshot; an R2 reader never
  assumes the object matches the last WS frame.
- **Bridge 3a/3b/3c/3d are the four 3x workstreams.** 3a is open first (BetTicker → WS + R2);
  3b is pending-bet liability; 3c is GSLive tally; 3d is Fantasy402 graded/settled. They are
  separate rows on purpose — do not merge 3c and 3d.
- **Snapshots with a pointer:** 3c/3d write an immutable daily rollup and then `latest.json` as a
  pointer (`{deskDate,key,sha256,generatedAt}`); the pointer is the only mutable object. Stream 1/2/3
  use a latest-snapshot object directly (no daily rollup).
- **Dedupe keys are not published:** `${TicketNumber}-${WagerNumber}`, `M.G<betGroupId>`, and
  `${Login}|${WagerNumber}|${TicketNumber}` are internal aggregation keys only; no identifier,
  ticket, wager or group id appears in WS payloads or R2 objects.
- **No raw rows anywhere:** the PII rules in [`pii_sanitization.md`](./pii_sanitization.md) apply to
  every stream; `betReport-all.json` and raw ticker/pending/graded rows are never uploaded.
- Stream 6 objects are immutable evidence; deleting them is explicit cleanup, not a freshness
  signal. Stream 7 is a single-writer snapshot and never carries raw rows.
