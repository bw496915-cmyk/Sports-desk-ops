## Section 1 — Data-Oriented Design grounding and empirical census

Data-Oriented Design starts from measured layouts and transformations, not speculative object
hierarchies: Richard Fabian, [Data-Oriented Design (2018)](https://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodbook/);
Mike Acton, [CppCon 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc). The target is
cache-contiguous Structure-of-Arrays columns sized from the census below.

**Census source:** `docs/evidence/captures/2026-11-01/Pending.post.json` (body skeleton),
`tests/f402-pending-wager-sample.json` (46-field sample), `tests/fixtures/pending-panel-datatables-2026-11-03.html`
(8 display columns, 8 rows), `data/live-bets.json` (`pendingCount: 2`).

| Census metric                                       | 3b observation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Alphabet bitmask convention: bit0 `A-Z`, bit1 `a-z`, bit2 `0-9`, bit3 `_`, bit4 `.`, bit5 `@`,
bit6 `-`, bit7 non-ASCII, bit8 other printable.

**Streaming census execution (Phase 1):** the 3c `betReport-all.json` pass used a chunked
`JSONDecoder.raw_decode` over `r.bets`, discarding each row after its aggregates were updated; no
output file, no row sample, no field value was printed. The 3b/3d census used the committed
pending skeleton/sample/panel and the graded parser fixtures in memory. The executable four-harness
was run read-only and reported `ALL 4 DOMAIN HARNESSES … PASSED`.

**B_max and enum cardinalities (3b snapshot):** the 3b **natural dimension set** is
`(rotation, sport, period)`; on the 2-game snapshot `B_max=2`. Observed enums: WagerType 1;
WagerStatus 1; period 2; sport 2; sub-sport 2; FreePlayFlag 1; all from the 2-game snapshot, not a
full 73-field row capture. `B_max` is always tied to this dimension set, never a generic count.

**Census record and failure policy:** the aggregate census is committed at
[`census/2026-11-04.json`](./census/2026-11-04.json). The Phase 1 runner emits stdout only; this JSON
is the transcribed aggregate record, containing no rows or identifiers. Missing fixture, non-zero
harness, or an unparseable row aborts the census — no partial design numbers. Missing optional live
headers are recorded as gaps, not silently substituted.

The harness contains **no external vendor control total**; GATE-03's named external source for 3b
must come from `Report/Pending` summary / Mode 9. The committed `Pending.post.json` skeleton exposes
only the `Pending` array (73 fields) and no summary header field; the secondary intra-endpoint
header is therefore a **live-capture gap** to close before implementation.

**Upstream header/field observations:** `Pending.post.json` response keys are
`bodySha256, bodySkeleton, bytes, contentType, status`; the only skeleton field is `Pending` (array).
`getGrading.post.json` exposes `LIST` as a string; `getDailyFiguresByCustomer.post.json` exposes
`INFO` as a boolean. No `markets-report`/`users-report` capture exists in
`docs/evidence/captures/2026-11-01/`; those live headers remain external arbiters, not committed
fixtures.

**Runtime boundary — Bun service, Node Harness:** Bridge 3 executes entirely under Bun in
`sportsdesk-ops` (`:4020`). The Harness host is Node (`:3080`) and has no `Bun` global. Any
Harness-facing view of Bridge 3 (gates, freshness, census) must be a thin HTTP client against
`:4020`, not an import of Bun-only modules — the same class of failure `dsh-plugin/verify-runtime.mjs`
exists to catch. `Bun.secrets` access is confined to the service; the Host receives credentials only
via the service's HTTP surface.

## Section 2 — Census-derived SoA layout, allocation boundary, overflow

- **C_max=2**, but the 73-field wire and panel fixtures justify a fixed table floor. Radix size:
  `2^k >= 4 × C_max`; with the floor `2^12`, `k=12` (4,096 probes) for 3b.
- **Identifier hashing:** stream raw UTF-8 byte spans into FNV-1a-64, trimming ASCII `0x20` at the
  edges without allocating a `.trim()` substring. Observed alphabet bitmask 5 fits in raw bytes;
  no Base-40 packing is used (no allocation/decoding benefit for a 5-byte identifier).
- **SoA store (contiguous, fixed capacity):**
  ```text
  packedCellKeyCol: Uint32Array
  ticketCountCol: Uint32Array
  legCountCol: Uint32Array
  riskCentsCol: BigInt64Array
  settledNetCentsCol: BigInt64Array
  definedLiabilityCentsCol: BigInt64Array
  clvSumLineHundredthsCol: BigInt64Array
  clvEligibleLegCountCol: Uint32Array
  cellFlagsBitSet: Uint32Array
  ```
- **Memory invariant:** zero collection-heap allocations on the aggregation path. No `Map`, `Set`,
  `boolean[]`, or dynamic `T[]` resizing. Column capacities are allocated once from `C_max` and the
  radix table; the only growth is the preallocated arena.
  **Status (measured 2026-11-04):** Bridge 3b (`lib/f402_pending_rollup.ts`) Struct-of-Arrays lowering complete with 0 collection allocations. Open-addressed hash slots with full probe verification, `PackedPendingKey32` 32-bit keys, cache-contiguous TypedArray columns (`packedCellKeyCol`, `ticketCountCol`, `legCountCol`, `riskCentsCol`, `settledNetCentsCol`, `definedLiabilityCentsCol`, `clvSumLineHundredthsCol`, `clvEligibleLegCountCol`, `cellFlagsBitSet`), and k=5 complementary sibling suppression over Uint32Array bitsets. Ratchet enforced in `tests/tally_allocation_invariant.test.ts`. Verification: `bun test tests/tally_allocation_invariant.test.ts` asserts 0 `Map`/`Set` collection allocations. Note: in this design revision GATE-02 is `UnsignedHandleAndKeyIntegrity`, not the allocation invariant, so the heap profile is recorded as allocation-invariant evidence, not as a GATE-02 artifact.
- **Inline legs:** `InlineCapacityList<LegSlot, 8>`; census P100=1, so 8 slots have 8× headroom.
  If a ticket exceeds 8 legs, use the bounded overflow slab (64 slots) and increment
  `overflowTicketCount`; if the slab is exhausted, fail closed via GATE-05. Never drop a leg or
  reject a valid ticket silently.
- **Radix table:** 4,096 entries, load factor `C_max / 4096 ≤ 0.25`; a probe hit re-checks the full
  64-bit key (GATE-01/02).

**Per-stream key: `PackedPendingKey32`.** 3b has exactly three natural dimensions:
`(rotation, sport, period)` with census-derived widths `rotation:20 | sport:6 | period:6 = 32`.
There is no `wagerType` or `settlementState` in the 3b bucket (Pending is open by definition); they
are **not zero-filled placeholders in a five-field superset**. If any field exceeds 64 values or
the rotation exceeds 20 bits, escalate to `PackedPendingKey64: BigUint64Array` with explicit widths
derived from the new census; never widen one field by borrowing another's bits. The
`pack(encode(decode(x))) !== x` round-trip check sets `packingRoundTripFailed=true` on
`DodGateFailureError`.

**Collision budget:** FNV-1a-64 at `C_max ≈ 64K` has expected collisions ≤ `6×10⁻⁸` per period;
that is accepted (≤`10⁻⁷`). The deduped ticket identity additionally keeps a full secondary key
(`TicketNumber/WagerNumber`) and a second pass disambiguates any observed collision before
GATE-03 counts are published. Count-only identity structures use 128-bit keys if a second
collision is observed.

**Allocation boundary:** streamed identifier bytes are hashed directly (FNV-1a-64), and the
identifier alphabet mask (bitmask 5) confirms no allocation-heavy decoding is needed. No
`Map`/`Set`/`boolean[]` or dynamic arrays on the aggregation path; only the fixed radix table and
SoA arena.

## Section 3 — Fixed-point accounting and cross-system reconciliation

Branded integers only: `Cents`, `SettledCents`, `BasisPoints`, `LineHundredths`,
`RotationNumber`; no IEEE-754 floats.

- **Rotation:** validate 20-bit `0..1,048,575`; if `5000..5999`, `rotation -= 5000` (Alt-Spread);
  never `rot & 0xFFFF`. Strip `Period`/`Live` prefixes before comparison.
- **Effective lines:** parse `AdjSpread`, `AdjTotalPoints`, `TeaserPoints` to `LineHundredths`
  (`×100`, round once, reject non-finite). `sideSign = +1` for team1, `-1` for team2;
  `effectiveSpread = adjSpread ± teaser`; totals flip sign for Over vs Under. Store the bounded
  `over|under` and `home|away` tags in `cellFlagsBitSet`.
- **Dedupe:** `${Login.trim()}|${WagerNumber}|${TicketNumber}`; first occurrence of
  `${TicketNumber}-${WagerNumber}-${totalPicks}` wins. `totalStakeCents` and
  `potentialPayoutCents` once per parent; `definedLiabilityCents = potentialPayoutCents` (gross
  worst-case payout; `netExposureCents = max(payout-stake,0)` diagnostic only).
- **Conservation:** `sum(visible.metric)+suppressedResidual.metric === rawDedup.metric` for
  ticketCount, legCount, stake, payout, liability.
- **Reconciliation (3c ↔ 3b/3d):** `3c.openExposureCents == 3b.definedLiabilityCents` for the
  GSLIVE+GSBUILDER slice, after the three divergence buckets: desk-date/UTC boundary,
  widget-rejected/cancelled, unsettled cross-window carry. Residual beyond tolerance fails GATE-08.

**BigInt sentinel and banker's rounding:** CLV is stored/compared only as BigInt:
`NULL_CLV_SENTINEL_BIGINT = -2147483648n`; no dead-code number variant. 3c's
`computeSettledRoiBasisPoints(netCents, settledStakedCents)` uses round-half-to-even in BigInt; the
signed `roundingResidualCents: bigint` is accumulated in `suppressed` and added algebraically to
the GATE-03 identity so arbitrary bucket counts still tie to the exact cent. 3b's `definedLiability`
and stake math also use BigInt64 columns only.

**3b GATE-03 roll-forward (principal-only):**
`OpeningPending_{t-1}^{vendor} + BetTickerInflow_t - GradedSettledPrincipal_t -
VoidedCancelledPrincipal_t` is the **left-hand external triangulated control**, compared with
**`ClosingPending_t = totalStakeCents`** from 3b. The identity is stated in **principal (stake)
cents**: `definedLiabilityCents` and `potentialPayoutCents` are **not** terms in this roll-forward.
Opening pending comes from the prior period's signed vendor report, never from 3b's prior output.
Voided/cancelled principal is deducted unless getGrading already includes voids at principal stake
with `netCents=0`. All terms use the same temporal cutoff (UTC; desk-date terms converted
explicitly). The intra-endpoint `Report/Pending` summary header is a secondary wire tie-out only.

**Separate liability bound (not the roll-forward):**
`definedLiabilityCents <= min(potentialPayoutCents, capCents × distinctTicketCount)`; a capped
ticket example ($1,000 risk / $10,000 toWin / $5,000 cap) must satisfy
`100000 <= min(1000000, 500000)` without perturbing the principal roll-forward.

**3d external control:** `sum(visibleCells)+suppressedResidual+roundingResidualCents ≡
ExternalReportControlTotal` and `sum(dedupedParentTicketsRead) ≡ VendorReportTicketCount` against
`getDailyFiguresByCustomer` / `getAgentPerformance` / the four-harness oracle header.

**Idempotency and restartability (launchd restart is the normal case):** `:4020` runs under Bun as a
child of the Harness host, so a launchd `KeepAlive` cycle or a job kill can land mid-rollup.
Re-running one `(stream=3b, desk-date)` must reproduce byte-identical artifacts: deterministic
cell/row ordering, including the `roundingResidualCents` carry, and any `generatedAt` records the
**capture** time, never the run time. The sink never publishes a partial artifact —
`writeWithMetadata` either completes or aborts — and `latest.json` advances only after the full
artifact and its metadata commit. This is the same never-discard, fail-closed rule as Bridge 1,
stated per stream because restart is the normal case here rather than the exception.

## Section 4 — Complete GATE-01..08 catalog

**Scope:** GATE-01..08 are design obligations that the eventual 3b/3c/3d implementations must
satisfy. This PR specifies them; it does not implement or run them. SHIP=1 in this PR covers the
docs only.

**Execution order:** GATE-01..03 run sequentially (fail-fast) pre-serialization; GATE-04/05 run as
a paired post-serialization block before in-process key-table teardown; GATE-06..08 run
sequentially. GATE-07 is a merge-blocker on 3d until Finance signs the FreePlay policy.

**DodGateFailureError payload (all gates):**

```ts
new DodGateFailureError({
  gate: 1..8,
  gateName: string,
  streamId: "f402-pending",
  cells: number[],          // cell indices, never values
  varianceCents: bigint,
  rowCountDelta: number,
  controlSource: string,    // named external arbiter
});
```

FreePlay is counted (`freePlayLossRows`, `freePlayUnknownRows`) but its money policy is governed by
GATE-07 and is not enabled here.

**Artifact ceiling derivation (GATE-05):** `ROLLUP_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES =
min(256 KiB, max(64 KiB, ceil(B_max × 512 bytes × 1.25) + 12 KiB header))`. The 1.25 safety factor
is the reviewed headroom for dimension-label growth between censuses; with B_max=2/118/6 for
3b/3c/3d the defaults are 64 KiB, 86 KiB, and 64 KiB. `stripUtf8Bom()` and `x-amz-meta-pii: none`
are applied before the size check.

**GATE-04 lifetime detail:** `assertNoPersistedHandleKeys()` runs before the radix/key TypedArrays
are torn down, walking the serialized artifact key-by-key against the live dedupe structure. If
lifetime forces early release, it falls back to a streaming scan of input row keys against the
artifact and records that fallback in the gate result.

**Extended `DodGateFailureError` payload (all gates):** `cellsUnpacked: null` unless 3c/3b can
expose de-identified cell tuples; `packingRoundTripFailed: true` only when GATE-02's
`pack(encode(decode(x))) !== x`. `cells` may contain bigint handles only until GATE-04 proves they
are not in the serialized artifact.

```ts
new DodGateFailureError({
  gate: 1..8,
  gateName: string,
  streamId: "3b-f402-pending",
  cells: Array<number | bigint>,
  cellsUnpacked: Array<Record<string, string>> | null, // stream-specific keys: rotation,sport,period
  packingRoundTripFailed?: boolean,
  varianceCents: bigint,
  rowCountDelta: number,
  controlSource: string,
});
```

**`B_max` is per-fixture; the artifact bound is deploy-time:** `B_max` in Section 1 is the
**per-fixture** measured cardinality. `ROLLUP_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` is a **deploy-time** bound derived
from `B_max_production`, measured from the first real capture of each stream, not from the census
fixture. The census-derived default (64 KiB for 3b/3d, 86 KiB for 3c) is a floor; it must be raised
at deploy time if the first real capture exceeds it. GATE-05 failure on a correct rollup is a signal
to measure, not to widen the bound.

Tests must use raw fixtures only through aggregate assertions; no stdout rows or PII values.

**Gaming-audit scope:** GATE-03 is a tie-out to an external vendor report, not independent
validation. Third-source validation (GL entries, bank settlement, or customer-level statements) is
out of scope for Bridge 3 and must be performed by Finance/Compliance at the period level before
these rollups are used for financial reporting.
