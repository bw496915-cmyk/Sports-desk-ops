# Feature: operator surfaces (GSLive, docs, stale cohort, live ingest)

**Surface.** Bun CLI commands plus the static portal artifacts they generate. No long-lived server
is required for the fixture path; `--live` and `--live-f402` make outbound reads.

**Map.** This file is the operator-facing companion to the token-gate features. Data mappings live in
[`docs/REAL_INGESTION.md`](../../../../docs/REAL_INGESTION.md#31-wire--feed-mapping) §3.1; GSLive
surface rules in [`docs/report-surfaces.md`](../../../../docs/report-surfaces.md).

## Preconditions

- Bun 1.4.4, repo root, `bun install --frozen-lockfile`.
- `./bin/dx doctor` equivalents: run `../../bin/doctor.sh` before the first drive.
- Live drives are opt-in: `SPORTSDESK_LIVE_INGEST=1`, `SPORTSDESK_LIVE_F402=1`, `F402_LIVE_LOGIN=1`.
  Fixture drives never touch the network.

## Drives

| Feature id | Command | Pass signal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dx-help` | `./bin/dx help` | exit 0; lists `gslive`, `docs`, `stale`, `poll`, `watch` |
| `gslive-links` | `./bin/dx gslive AF12` | report URL has `text=player_AF12`; bet-history has `partnerUserId=AF12` and both `dateFilterBy` values |
| `gslive-docs` | `./bin/dx docs --json` | JSON has `provider: "GSLive Manager (Partner 118)"` and 3 surfaces |
| `stale-cohort` | `./bin/dx stale -i <export.csv> --window-min 10` | seeded event cluster lists the seed `★` and other customers |
| `poll-fixture` | `./bin/dx poll --once` | feed `dataMode: "FIXTURE"`, 39 profiles |
| `poll-live` | `./bin/dx poll --once --live` | feed `dataMode: "PARTIAL"`, `provenance.polymarket.walletsOk` 20–23, `walletsInvalid` 16 |
| `poll-f402-off` | `./bin/dx poll --once --live-f402` without `F402_LIVE_LOGIN=1` | warns `F402 live login disabled`; exit 0; `provenance.f402.source: "fixture"` |
| `portal-contract` | `bun test tests/gslive_portal_links.test.ts tests/cli_terminal_automation.test.ts tests/pipeline_assets.test.ts` | pass |

## Mapping checks

- Money: F402 wire `Risk`/`ToWin` are **cents**; the feed publishes **USD**. Never compare directly.
- Time: wire `InsertDateTime` is UTC-5; feed timestamps are UTC ISO; desk-day bounds are
  `America/Chicago` (`computeDeskDayStartEpochSeconds`, DST-aware `toTime`).
- Identity: `text=player_<LOGIN>` only on `#/reports/users`; `partnerUserId=<LOGIN>` (raw) only on
  `#/events/bet-history`.
- Provenance: per wallet `dataSource` is `LIVE | STALE | FIXTURE`; `walletAddressValid: false` marks
  the 16 placeholder rows and their numbers must be 0.
- `pendingBets` is fixture until a `getPending` response is captured and mapped; `dataMode` cannot
  reach `LIVE` before that.

## Evidence

Store `log.txt`, `status.txt`, and the generated `docs/graph-live-feed.json` under
`$SPORTSDESK_VERIFY_EVIDENCE/operator-surfaces/<run-id>/`. Do not commit live feed output from a
drive; the committed feed is refreshed by `./bin/dx poll --live`.

## Known limits

- 16 configured wallet addresses are truncated/synthetic; live totals cover 23 wallets.
- F402 is a `getBetTicker` probe only: rows are counted, not mapped (`mapped: false`).
- CLOB WSS is not ingested; `wssIngestion` is `"not_ingested"` and the 345 ms figure is a fixture
  sample.
