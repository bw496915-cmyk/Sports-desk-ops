/**
 * @file lib/artifacts_lock.ts
 * @description Record and verify the inputs behind the committed value artifacts.
 *
 * Regenerating `docs/combo-uniqueness.json` and `docs/cross-domain-bridge.json` needs live data, so
 * CI cannot rebuild them. What CI can do is notice that the generator or its libraries changed after
 * the artifacts were last written — which is the case that actually produces a stale artifact.
 *
 * Limitation, stated plainly: this proves nothing changed *since the lock was taken*. It cannot prove
 * the locked artifacts were produced by the locked inputs, because that would require a regeneration
 * with live data. Run `artifacts:value` and then `artifacts:lock --update` together, always.
