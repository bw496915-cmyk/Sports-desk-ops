/**
 * Prose citations in docs/openapi.json rot silently.
 *
 * They are hand-written strings like `services/sportsdesk_webview_server.ts:114-131`, so moving
 * code does not update them and the docs gate cannot see them. Measured 2026-11-01: 18 of 110
 * no longer pointed at code — nine named a file that had moved under docs/runbooks/, and five
 * landed on a bare `}`, `);` or `},`.
 *
 * The audit cannot know what a sentence meant, so it only reports anchors that are objectively
 * gone: file missing, line out of range, blank, or nothing but closing punctuation.
