/**
 * The guard, tested at the network boundary rather than through the code that implements it.
 *
 * Every existing server test connects over loopback, where `piiRejection` deliberately allows the
 * request — so a route that lost its guard call would pass the whole suite. That is not
 * hypothetical: /graph and /api/analysis both served customer identifiers unguarded while the
 * table claimed otherwise, and no test could see it.
 *
 * This binds 0.0.0.0, connects from a non-loopback address, and asserts the routes the table
 * marks `pii` refuse the request. An unguarded route is the control: if it also refused, the
 * failure would be the network, not the guard.
 *
 * Skips cleanly when the machine has no non-loopback IPv4, rather than passing vacuously and
 * reporting coverage it does not have.
