/**
 * A public route must not serve an artifact that contains identifiers.
 *
 * `dataClass` is a judgement, so a wrong judgement passes the type: the guarded/unguarded union
 * only rejects declaring `customer-identifying` data as public, not declaring it `aggregate` when
 * it is not. That is exactly what happened — five graph routes were classified `aggregate` and
 * served `docs/graph.html`, whose 640 KB payload carries BILLY666, RF2003, BGD101, CUB22HR and
 * MM800. A probe for the word "login" in the markup returned false, because the page has no such
 * label.
 *
 * So this checks values, not schema: it reads the artifact each file-serving arm points at and
 * fails if a public route serves one that contains a known identifier.
 *
 * Scope: arms that call `Bun.file(resolve(repoRoot, …))` directly. Pages loaded once at startup
 * into a const (the dashboard, the mini app) are not visible to this scan, which is why the table
 * must still be right about them.
